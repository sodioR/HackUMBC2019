## _Welcome to Bender.com!_ 

_Our web application is meant to be a convinient means of finding a decent meal at a specific budget, promoting local restaurants._
## Inspiration
_Being incredible broke and having a very specific (and very little) amount of money, it always took my friends and I an inordinate amount of time to figure a decent place to eat out that wasn't McDonalds or any other fast food chain._

## What it does
_The user enters a budget and a location radius, and the application provides results of restaurants within the parameters input and where the average cost of a meal falls with in the budget._

## How we built it  
_  _

## Challenges we ran into 
_Maaaaaaaaaany challenges, primarily time. We had initially planned to create a website along the web application, however we could not finish it. Also the typescript was...challenging._

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 
_Being the first time delving into UI design, while very simple, came out presentable! I look forward to trying it again and improving and learning more._

## What we learned 
_UI design, UI component application and implementation, how annoying typescript._

## What's next for Bender 
_GROCERIES_
